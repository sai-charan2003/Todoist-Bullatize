# Todoist Bullatize

Todoist Bullatize is a Flutter app that converts all your Todoist tasks into a bullet list. You may wonder why this is needed — but why not?

For each version I build, I create a section in a Todoist project to keep track of tasks for every change. When making a changelog, it’s a bit tedious to copy everything, so I built this service to simplify the process by converting my tasks into a bullet list format.

To use the app, simply paste your Todoist API key, which you can find on the Todoist integrations page. Rest assured, your API key is secure; it’s only stored locally in your browser using SharedPreferences, not on any cloud server.

## How to Use the App Version Tracker API

**Open the app**: Open the [Web App](https://todoistbullatize.vercel.app/) or android app and paste your todoist api key.
